Program Name: Pos Neg Zero Decider
Author:ENR 102 CLASS
Date: 2/7/19
Program Description: This program will determine if the number you enter is either positive, negative, or zero. User can enter an integer or a floating point number. Program outputs...

### Get rid of steps to problem after writing program descrip.###
Steps to solve problem:
1- Output message to user explaining what the program does and how it works (cout statements)
2- Ask user to input number, can be integer, floating point, pos, neg, or zero
3- Bring in user's number and store in num, data type double
3a- Output number for user
4- Use if to check if num is neg... If (num < 0) "number is negative"
5- Else if (num==0) "number is zero"
6- else output "number is positive"
7- Output "Thank you and goodbye" and end program (return 0)

	//First test if num is less than 0, then test if equal to 0, all other tests lead to a positive number
